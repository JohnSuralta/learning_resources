## Why This Resource?

This was my very first introduction to python and the material is easy to grasp.
Personally, the problems were quite difficult for beginners, but I found it to be super helpful. The difficulty forced me to read documentation and discern which programming concepts I must use to get the desired output. I would highly recommend this course for people new to programming.
