# Python Crash Course 3rd Edition 

This book is, as said in the name, a crash course on the python programming language.
This book introduces basic programming concepts like lists, dictionaries, etc.

# Why This Resource?

I used this resource as a supplement to the CS50P Harvard course for learning python.
I think this book is super useful because in the first part it teaches you
the basic programming concepts and in the second part you go feet first into some
projects using python. Through the projects, you get introduced to different
fields like game development, data science, and web development.
