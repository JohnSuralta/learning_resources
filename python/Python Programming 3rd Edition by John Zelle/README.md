This book is an introduction to computer science using the programming language

concepts.

# Why This Resource?

I am using this book to solidify my understanding of python that I gained from
the previous book. The way I will read this book is doing the exercises at the
end of each section, if I cannot solve the exercises I will read that section and 
review.
